# ✈️ Airline Flight Operations Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes airline flight operations to understand **pricing trends, delays, cancellations, and operational performance**. It combines **Python-based data analysis** with an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for clear, insight-driven visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze ticket pricing across airlines and travel classes  
- Study arrival, carrier, weather, and NAS delays  
- Identify cancellation patterns and key cancellation reasons  
- Explore time-based trends (day, week, month)  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI Desktop (DAX)

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- KPI overview (Total Flights, Avg Delay, Cancellation Rate, Avg Price)  
- Airline-wise price and delay comparison  
- Delay analysis by cause (Carrier, Weather, NAS)  
- Cancellation reason breakdown  
- Time and class-based insights  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Pricing and punctuality vary significantly across airlines  
- Carrier and NAS delays occur more frequently than weather delays  
- Cancellation rates are relatively low but dominated by specific reasons  
- Business class fares are consistently higher than economy class fares
